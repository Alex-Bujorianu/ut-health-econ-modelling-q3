#Conclusion: lognormal is a good fit with the male age. 
#It matches the shape on the histogram and has a low Akaikeâ€™s score, indicating good fit.
#The P-P plot and CDF graph looks good as well.
# The female ages are skewed and look like they would fit better with a gamma distribution.

#Gamma distribution still not a good fit

        fitnames=c("Weibull", "Gamma", "Lognormal"))

#The weibull distribution looks like the best fit graphically based on the histogram and Q-Q plot
# The statistics are pretty similar between the distributions (none of them are an amazing fit).
# However, the von Mises and Anderson Darling statistics are much better for the Weibull distribution. 
# These tests are appropriate because if the data is continuous (and age is continuous) then
# the tests are independent of the distribution being tested.
# The Anderson Darling test gives extra weight to the tails and this is where Weibull performs notably better.
# Small A-S statistic = better
# We will go with Weibull.
