# ut-health-econ-modelling-q3
A repo to share code for the assignment on the UT health economic modelling course. By Alex and Rusheel.

To run the model on your computer: 

1. Copy the URL and open it as a new project in RStudio (select the From Version Control option).
2. In the R console, type setwd("R/"). We could not get the setwd command to run reliably inside the script itself.
