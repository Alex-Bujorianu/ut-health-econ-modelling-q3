## Answers to Questions

**Determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the intervention strategy compared
with the control strategy.**

``` {r PSA-Analysis.R, echo=FALSE}
print(ICER)
```

As we can see, the ICER is about €28,000. This would be acceptable if society were willing to pay €80,000 per QALY but not if society were willing to pay only €20,000 per QALY.

**Create an incremental cost-effectiveness plane and visualize the incremental effects (x-axis) and
incremental costs (y-axis) of the intervention strategy compared with the control strategy.
Provide a correct label for both axes.**

```{r PSA-Analysis.R, echo=FALSE}
plot(plane, xlab="Incremental effects", ylab="Incremental costs")
```
**Add two solid lines to this plane, one representing a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of
€20,000 per QALY gained, and one representing a willingness-to-pay threshold of €80,000 per
QALY gained.**



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
