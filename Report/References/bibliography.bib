abstract = {Abstract The epidemiology of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and the associations of GBS with influenza vaccination are described based on review of three types of epidemiological data: case-control studies, incidence rate studies of GBS in well-defined populations, and surveillance data from a sentinel neurologist surveillance system of GBS in the United States. These data indicate that the crude annual incidence rate of GBS per 100,000 people ranges from 0.6 to 1.9 in different populations in widely scattered areas of the world. In general, incidence rates are higher with advancing age until about 75 years, higher for men than women, and higher for whites than blacks. No specific HLA antigen has been significantly associated with GBS in general, although HLA AW 30 and AW 31 have been associated with chronic relapsing polyneuritis. Important trigger agents of GBS include nonspecific respiratory and gastrointestinal infections and cytomegalovirus infection. Influenza infection and influenza vaccinations are not generally important trigger agents. A major exception to this is the occurrence of just under 1 excess case of GBS per 100,000 A/New Jersey influenza vaccinations administered in the United States, 1976–1977. A significant exces risk of GBS was not observed after administration of influenza vaccine in 1978–1979 and 1979–1980. The differences between the contents of and immunological reaction to A/New Jersey influenza vaccine and the more recent influenza vaccines deserve further study.},

abstract = {Background
Cost-effectiveness analysis can guide policymakers in resource allocation decisions. It assesses whether the health gains offered by an intervention are large enough relative to any additional costs to warrant adoption. When there are constraints on the health care system’s budget or ability to increase expenditures, additional costs imposed by interventions have an “opportunity cost” in terms of the health foregone because other interventions cannot be provided. Cost-effectiveness thresholds (CETs) are typically used to assess whether an intervention is worthwhile and should reflect health opportunity cost. Nevertheless, CETs used by some decision makers—such as the World Health Organization that suggested CETs of 1 to 3 times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita—do not.
Objectives
To estimate CETs based on opportunity cost for a wide range of countries.
Methods
We estimated CETs based on recent empirical estimates of opportunity cost (from the English National Health Service), estimates of the relationship between country GDP per capita and the value of a statistical life, and a series of explicit assumptions.
Results
CETs for Malawi (the country with the lowest income in the world), Cambodia (with borderline low/low-middle income), El Salvador (with borderline low-middle/upper-middle income), and Kazakhstan (with borderline high-middle/high income) were estimated to be $3 to $116 (1%–51% GDP per capita), $44 to $518 (4%–51%), $422 to $1967 (11%–51%), and $4485 to $8018 (32%–59%), respectively.
Conclusions
To date, opportunity-cost-based CETs for low-/middle-income countries have not been available. Although uncertainty exists in the underlying assumptions, these estimates can provide a useful input to inform resource allocation decisions and suggest that routinely used CETs have been too high.}
